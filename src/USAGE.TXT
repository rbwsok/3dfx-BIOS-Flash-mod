This UserFlash utility has been adapted to serve as the back end 
for a localized interface that can be used in a disk image.
It is command line driven and has been updated with the 
following switches:

 /U	Updates the table of register settings using the new 
	file settings. 
	(Default - the existing settings are merged into the 
	the new BIOS file as it is flashed.)   

 /W	Hides user interface queries.
	(Required for following switches).

 /V	Hides acknowledgement of version check results.

 /S	Hides acknowledgement of Subsystem ID check.

 /I	Hides acknowledgement of information mismatch.  

It incorporates the preservation of the VPD info and the register 
settings table.

It also includes the support for the SST 39VF512 EEPROM and a 
version checking function.
